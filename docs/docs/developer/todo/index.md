# TODO Backlog

This backlog has been normalized and reorganized into three workstreams.

Rules now applied:

- All tasks are intentionally unchecked (`[ ]`).
- Tasks are grouped by logical workstream.
- Priorities are sorted high to low within each workstream (`P1` → `P2` → `P3`).

## Workstreams

- [Platform and Architecture](platform-and-architecture.md)
- [Product, Security, and Quality](product-security-and-quality.md)
- [Documentation and Operations](documentation-and-operations.md)

## Priority Legend

- `P1` = critical / current sprint
- `P2` = near-term
- `P3` = follow-on

## Owner Legend

- `Backend`
- `Frontend`
- `Docs`
- `DevOps`
- `Security`
