## Reprioritization Note (2026-02-19)

Recent architecture clarification reframes ITSoR as an asset-centric, control-aware operational intelligence platform.

Backlog prioritization should now favor:

1. Asset + relationship + temporal state foundations
2. Control assertion + evidence chain modeling
3. Drift and posture computation reliability
